- GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy.
- GPT-3.5 Turbo models can understand and generate natural language or code and have been optimized for chat using the Chat Completions API.
- DALLÂ·E is a AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language.
- TTS is an AI model that converts text to natural sounding spoken text.
- Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.
- Embeddings are a numerical representation of text that can be used to measure the relatedness between two pieces of text.
  Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, and classification tasks.
- The Moderation models are designed to check whether content complies with OpenAI's usage policies.
  The models provide classification capabilities that look for content in the following categories: hate, hate/threatening, self-harm, sexual, sexual/minors, violence, and violence/graphic.
